# ECG-VFonset-Extractor

This code slices samples from the WFDB database and slices it into a smaller segment close to the VFOnset time.

# Future implementations

Future implementations include:

*Allowing users to connect to the WFDB and utilize files on that database instead of having to manually download the files.

*Allowing for GUI to let users input desired database, sampling direction (starting with or ending with the VFOnset), and sample length.
