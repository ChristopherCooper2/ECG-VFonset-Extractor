# ECG-VFonset-Extractor

This code takes samples from the WFDB database and slices it into a smaller segment close to the VFOnset time. It then creates a new file with only the cut segment.

# Future implementations

Future implementations include:

*Allowing users to connect to the WFDB and utilize files on that database instead of having to manually download the files.

*Allowing for GUI/better console to allow users to input desired database, sampling direction (starting with or ending with the VFOnset), timesacle, and sample length.

*Placing the XQRS results into a readable file instead of just console outputs.
